# 32-bit-Microprocessor
This is a 32-bit Microprocessor based on MISP-32 Microprocessor architecture.
RISC architecture has been used in this processor.
Code of processor is well pipelined for parallel computation.
32-bit ALU accompanied for branching instruction has been created.
This processor has been testbenched for addition, subtraction and multiplication operations.
